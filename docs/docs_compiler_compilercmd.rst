Compiler
========

The ZTC compiler takes a project as input and produces an executable bytecode file ready to be :ref:`uplinked <ztc-cmd-uplink>` on a :ref:`virtualized <ztc-cmd-device-virtualize>`.

The command: ::
    
        ztc compile project target

compiles the source files found at :samp:`project` (the project path) for a device with target :samp:`target`.

The entry point of the program is the file :file:`main.py`. Every additional Python module needed wil be searched in the following order:

1. Project directory
2. Directories passed with the :option:`-I` option in the given order (see below)
3. The Zerynth standard library
4. The installed libraries

Since Zerynth programs allow mixed C/Python code, the compiler also scans for C source files and compiles them with the appropriate C compiler for :samp:`target`.
C object files are packed and included in the output bytecode.

The :command:`compile` command accepts additional options:

* :option:`-I/--include path`, adds :samp:`path` to the list of directories scanned for Zerynth modules. This option can be repeated multiple times.
* :option:`-D/--define def`, adds a C macro definition as a parameter for native C compiler. This option can be repeated multiple times.
* :option:`-o/--output path`, specifies the path for the output file. If not specified it is :file:`main.vbo` in the project folder.
