The Zerynth Package is extra plug-in of the Zerynth Backend composed by a file or a group of files 
encasing several specific tested features that customers can add to their projects installing it on their pc.

Each z-package is published in a domain related to a namespace directly linked to owner user in order to 
permit that every package has an unique and unambiguous path.

There are several types of Zerynth Packages; here a brief description:

* **core**: principal z-packages on which are based all the Zerynth Tools (Zerynth Studio, Zerynth Toolchain, Standard Library)
* **sys**: z-packages to add system tool platform dependent (Windows, Linux, Mac)
* **board**: z-packages to add new devices to the Zerynth Tools
* **vhal**: z-packages for virtual hardware abstract layer to add low level drivers grouped for microcontroller families
* **lib**: z-packages to add specific class and features to improve new features the z-devices
* **meta**: z-packages that contains list of other z-packages to be installed

Package Commands
================

This module contains all Zerynth Toolchain Commands for interacting with Zerynth Package Entities.
With this commands the Zerynth Users can install new available packages in their installation or can publish a new one 
using the command-line interface terminal.

In all commands is present a ``--help`` option to show to the users a brief description of the related selected command and its syntax including arguments and option informations.

All commands return several log messages grouped in 4 main levels (info, warning, error, fatal) to inform the users about the results of the operation. 
The actions that can be executed on Zerynth Packages are:

* info_: to display a Zerynth Package informations
* install_: to install one or more Zerynth Packages
* search__: to search Zerynth Packages according to keywords passed as text query
* publish_: to publisha new Zerynth Package
* update_all_: to update to the last version all Zerynth Packages already installed
* sync_: to sync all z-user local repository database
* published_: to display the list of published z-packages 
* installed_: to display the list of installed z-packages
* updated_: to display the list of updated z-packages
