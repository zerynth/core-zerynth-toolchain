Amazon Web Services

The integration between the Zerynth Toolchain and AWS command line tool allows to easily manage AWS resources while working on your embedded project.

.. note:: The Zerynth Toolchain assumes `AWS command line tool <https://aws.amazon.com/cli>`_ to be available and `configured <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html>`_ to handle AWS resources.

Since AWS Platform provides several services, this page wil report the documentation of each ztc-aws-integrated command in a proper section depending on referred AWS service:

    * :ref:`AWS IoT Platform <ztc-cmd-aws-iot_platform>`:

        * :ref:`thing-project-from-template <ztc-cmd-aws-thing_project_from_template>`
        * :ref:`add-things <ztc-cmd-aws-add_things>`
        * :ref:`set-active-thing <ztc-cmd-aws-set_active_thing>`
        * :ref:`iot-cleanup <ztc-cmd-aws-iot_cleanup>`

    
.. _ztc-cmd-aws-iot_platform:

****************
AWS IoT Platform
****************

AWS IoT is a managed cloud platform that lets connected devices easily and securely interact with cloud applications and other devices: `AWS IoT platform <https://aws.amazon.com/iot-platform/>`_.
It is officially supported by Zerynth powered devices through a :ref:`specific module <awsiot>`.

Zerynth Toolchain and AWS IoT Platform integration provides a full device project workflow: from single Thing creation and testing to :ref:`mass programming <ztc-cmd-aws-set_active_thing_note>` utilies for production environment.

    * New project setup is made easy thanks to the available :ref:`aws-iot enabled device project template <ztc-cmd-aws-thing_project_from_template>`.
    * Testing the project on a single device, authenticating as an on-the-fly generated AWS IoT Thing, is immediate with :ref:`add-things <ztc-cmd-aws-add_things>` command.
    * :ref:`Scaling <ztc-cmd-aws-set_active_thing_note>` to multiple devices is allowed by the same :ref:`add-things <ztc-cmd-aws-add_things>` in combination with :ref:`set-active-thing <ztc-cmd-aws-set_active_thing>` command.

Environment cleanup (both local and remote) is also possible through :ref:`iot-cleanup <ztc-cmd-aws-iot_cleanup>` command.

    
.. _ztc-cmd-aws-thing_project_from_template:

Create a generic AWS IoT Thing project from template
----------------------------------------------------

The command: ::

    ztc aws thing-project-from-template project-name path

Creates a Zerynth project called :samp:`project-name` inside a newly created :samp:`project-name` folder placed at provided :samp:`path`.

The Zerynth project will be a clone of a template project capable of connecting to a wifi network and sending mqtt messages to the AWS IoT MQTT Broker, and made of the following files: ::

    ├── main.py
    ├── helpers.py
    ├── readme.md
    └── thing.conf.json

Where :code:`main.py` will contain device task logic, made independent of AWS IoT Thing specific names and references which will be placed inside :code:`thing.conf.json` configuration file.

The command provides also useful options: ::

    --aws-endpoint      endpoint-name
    --aws-policy-name   policy-name

which allow to specify configuration parameters such as mqtt broker endpoint or devices policy, common to different Things, directly at project cloning time.
These options simply set values inside :code:`thing.conf.json` which can also be easily edited manually.

After customizing the code it will be necessary to generate an AWS IoT Thing to allow device authentication to AWS IoT Platform.

    
.. _ztc-cmd-aws-add_things:

Bind AWS IoT Things to a Zerynth Project
----------------------------------------

The command: ::

    ztc aws add-things project_path --things-base-name first_project_thing

will generate an AWS IoT Thing called :code:`first_project_thing_0` and download Thing private key and certificate inside Zerynth project folder placed at :code:`project_path`.
Private key and certificate among with a Thing specific :code:`thing.conf.json` will be stored inside :code:`first_project_thing_0` folder under :code:`.aws_things_resources` one placed at project top-level folder.

The newly created Thing will be set as the :ref:`active <ztc-cmd-aws-set_active_thing>` one and its specific configuration will be placed inside top-level :code:`thing.conf.json` and its key and certificate copied into :code:`private.pem.key` and :code:`certificate.pem.crt` files respectively.

The Project is now ready for :ref:`compilation <ztc-cmd-compile>` and :ref:`uplink <ztc-cmd-uplink>` processes.

After testing the project on a single Thing it will be possible to add multiple things to the same project through: ::

    ztc aws add-things project_path --things-number 10

creating 10 new Things with private keys and certificates with names from :code:`first_project_thing_1` to :code:`first_project_thing_10`. 
Otherwise it will be possible to specify a new base name calling again the proper option: ::

    ztc aws add-things project_path --things-number 10 --things-base-name production_thing

After creation it is needed to choose each time a single Thing for :ref:`compilation <ztc-cmd-compile>` and :ref:`uplink <ztc-cmd-uplink>`.

    
.. _ztc-cmd-aws-set_active_thing:

Set a Thing as active for compilation and uplink
------------------------------------------------

The command: ::

    ztc aws set-active-thing project_path --thing-id 0

will set :code:`thing_base_name_0` as active Thing (:code:`first_project_thing_0` following the example above) for the Zerynth project placed at :code:`project_path`.
The process consists in:

    * copying Thing private key and certificate to top-level project folder;
    * filling Thing specific fields inside :code:`thing.conf.json` configuration file:

        * certificate `Amazon Resource Name (ARN) <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`_, 
        * Thing name,
        * MQTT ID to log to AWS IoT MQTT Broker (same as Thing name).

.. _ztc-cmd-aws-set_active_thing_note:

A note on mass programming
--------------------------

The simple script ::

    #!/usr/bin/sh

    things_number=1000
    ztc=/ztc_path/ztc

    $ztc aws add-things project_path --things-number $things_number --thing-base-name production_thing
    for thing_id in $(seq 0 $(expr $things_number - 1)); do
        $ztc aws set-active-thing project_path --thing-id $thing_id 
        $ztc compile project_path target_device
        $ztc uplink target_device project_path/main.vbo
    done


allows to scale a single Thing project to an arbitrary number of Things.

    
.. _ztc-cmd-aws-iot_cleanup:

Cleanup project deleting bound AWS IoT Things
---------------------------------------------

The command: ::

    ztc aws iot-cleanup project_path

Deletes AWS IoT Things bound to Zerynth project placed at :code:`project_path` and attached keys and certificates.

.. warning:: clean up process acts both **locally** and **remotely**
